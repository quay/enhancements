# Project Quay Enhancement Proposal

An Project Quay Enhancement Proposal is a way to propose, communicate, and coordinate on
new efforts for the Project Quay project.

It is inspired from our experience with the Kubernetes Enhancement process where
many of our community participants collaborate each day.

## Quick start

1. Socialize an idea with others.  Make sure others think the work is worth
   doing, and are willing to review design and code changes required.
2. Follow the process outlined in the [enhancement
   template](template.md).

## FAQs

### Do I have to use the process?

If the enhancement has broad scope, yes.  It helps everyone track why, when,
how, and by whom work is done.

### Why would I want to use the process?

Provide a mechanism to communicate design and implementation strategies across
the Project Quay community.

### Do I put design in a particular directory?

If it has broad impact, place it in the root of this directory.  If it's
localized to a particular domain, find the appropriate directory.

### My FAQ isn't answered here!

Open an issue and ask or even better open a PR with a question and proposed
answer.
